Game to learn gcode

Here's a simple version of the G-code learning game using Python's tkinter library for visuals. This will create a basic GUI where you can learn G-codes:

How to Use:
Run the Python script. Make sure you have tkinter installed (it comes pre-installed with Python on most systems).

A window will appear with the game interface:
You'll see a G-code displayed.
Enter your guess in the text box.
Click "Submit" to check your answer.
The game will show if you're correct or not via a popup message, update your score, and then present the next G-code.

Game Mechanics:
Visual Learning: Instead of command line, this uses a GUI for interaction.
Feedback: Immediate visual feedback through message boxes.
Scoring System: Keeps track of your score visually on the screen.

Limitations & Enhancements:

Basic Knowledge: This still covers only a subset of G-codes. Expanding the dictionary would help in learning more.

Visual Limitations: While it provides visuals, it's still text-based regarding the teaching aspect. Adding images or animations that simulate what each G-code does could enhance learning.

Interactive Elements: You might consider adding buttons or dropdowns for answers to make it more interactive or quiz-like.
Remember, this game is educational and for basic learning. Real-world application and practice on a CNC simulator or machine would be essential for mastering G-code.
